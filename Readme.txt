This is planting growing game that allows players to grow their own plant and interact with each other. The players will need grow their plant from scratch. 

To run the game, we must first find the server file and enter the ip address of the computer you wish to run the server on. Then we run the main file.
If we are playing on multiple computer make sure the ip address of the server is entered at the right place of the main file. If we are playing the one computer, 
we open different command prompt and open the main file in it.

I used pygame in my game so it is important that pygame is installed.

The game allows negative money so you can anything you want in order for shortcut.
